    "Here are the parameters for the function and what they represent:\n",
    "   \n",
    "* prev first 8-bit single-channel input image.\n",
    "* next second input image of the same size and the same type as prev.\n",
    "* flow computed flow image that has the same size as prev and type CV_32FC2.\n",
    "* pyr_scale parameter, specifying the image scale (\\<1) to build pyramids for each image\n",
    "    * pyr_scale=0.5 means a classical pyramid, where each next layer is twice smaller than the previous one.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* levels number of pyramid layers including the initial image; levels=1 means that no extra layers are created and only the original images are used.\n",
    "* winsize averaging window size\n",
    "    * larger values increase the algorithm robustness to image\n",
    "* noise and give more chances for fast motion detection, but yield more blurred motion field.\n",
    "* iterations number of iterations the algorithm does at each pyramid level.\n",
    "* poly_n size of the pixel neighborhood used to find polynomial expansion in each pixel\n",
    "    * larger values mean that the image will be approximated with smoother surfaces, yielding more robust algorithm and more blurred motion field, typically poly_n =5 or 7.\n",
    "* poly_sigma standard deviation of the Gaussian that is used to smooth derivatives used as a basis for the polynomial expansion; for poly_n=5, you can set poly_sigma=1.1, for poly_n=7, a good value would be poly_sigma=1.5."
