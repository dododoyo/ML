# Machine Learning

- Has fundamentally three steps

> Data Preprocessing

- import data
- clean data
- split into training and test set

> Modelling

- build model
- train model
- make predictions

> Evaluation

- calculate performance metrics
- make a verdict

## Data-Set

- It is of two types Training Set and Testing Set

-

## Feature Scaling

- always applied to columns

Feature scaling should be performed after splitting the data into training and test sets to prevent data leakage and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Here are the key reasons:

1. **Preventing Data Leakage**: If you scale the entire dataset before splitting, information from the test set can influence the scaling parameters (e.g., mean and standard deviation for standardization). This can lead to data leakage, where the model indirectly gains information about the test set, resulting in overly optimistic performance estimates.

2. **Ensuring Generalization**: The goal of a machine learning model is to generalize well to new, unseen data. By scaling the training set independently, the model learns scaling parameters based only on the training data. These parameters are then applied to scale the test set, simulating how the model would handle new data in a real-world scenario.

3. **Consistency in Scaling**: When you scale the training set first and then apply the same scaling parameters to the test set, you ensure that both sets are scaled consistently. This consistency is crucial for the model to make accurate predictions.

4. **Avoiding Overfitting**: Scaling the entire dataset before splitting can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data. By scaling after splitting, you help the model to better capture the underlying patterns in the training data without being influenced by the test data.

In summary, performing feature scaling after splitting the data helps maintain the integrity of the test set, ensures consistent scaling, and promotes better generalization of the model.

> normalization // values will be between 0 and 1

- recommended for normally destributed data

X' = $\frac{X - Xmin}{Xmax-Xmin}$

> standardisation // values will be beteween -3 and +3

- works always

X' = $\frac{X - median}{S.D}$

we don't perform feature scaling on the dummy variables

Great question! The reason for using [`fit_transform`] on the test set lies in the difference between fitting and transforming data.

### [`fit_transform`] on Training Data

- **Fitting**: When you call [`fit_transform`] on the training data, the scaler (or any other transformer) computes the necessary statistics (e.g., mean and standard deviation for standard scaling) from the training data.
- **Transforming**: After computing these statistics, it immediately applies the transformation to the training data.

### [`transform`] on Test Data

- **Transforming Only**: When you call [`transform`] on the test data, it uses the statistics computed from the training data (during the `fit` step) to transform the test data. It does not recompute the statistics, ensuring that the test data is scaled in the same way as the training data.

### Why This Approach?

1. **Consistency**: By using the same statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) from the training data to transform the test data, you ensure that both datasets are scaled consistently. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the model's performance evaluation.
2. **Avoiding Data Leakage**: If you were to fit the scaler on the test data, you would be introducing information from the test set into the training process, which can lead to overfitting and an overly optimistic evaluation of the model's performance.

```python
X_train[:, 3:] = sc.fit_transform(X_train[:, 3:])
X_test[:, 3:] = sc.transform(X_test[:, 3:])
```

This ensures that both [`X_train`]and [`X_test`] are scaled consistently without any data leakage.

## Simple Linear Regression

### Ordinary Least Squares

if we have y = b0 + b1x
we want to have b0 and b1 such that sum[(yi -y)^2] is 
minimized this is called `Oridinary Least Squares`. 

### Statistical Significance

Imagine you have a big jar of colorful candies â€“ red, blue, and green. You want to know if there are more red candies than the other colors.

You ask your friend to close their eyes and pick out a handful of candies. Let's say they get mostly red ones! Does that mean there are definitely more red candies in the jar? Not so fast! It could be, or it could just be a lucky handful.

Statistical significance is like a detective's magnifying glass for situations like this. It helps us figure out if what we see (lots of red candies!) is truly meaningful or just random chance.

We do some math with the candies your friend picked and compare it to all the candies in the jar. If the math says it's very unlikely to get that many red candies just by chance, then we can be more confident that there really are more red candies in the jar. That's "statistically significant"!

In machine learning, we use this detective work to see if patterns we find in data are real or just flukes. If something is statistically significant, we can be more confident that our machine learning model is learning something true and not just making lucky guesses.

### p-value

A p-value is a measure used in statistical hypothesis testing to determine the significance of the results. It represents the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

The name "p-value" stands for "probability value." It represents the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. The "p" in p-value is derived from the word "probability."

### Key Points:

- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The default assumption that there is no effect or no difference.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The assumption that there is an effect or a difference.
- **Low p-value (< 0.05)**: Indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.
- **High p-value (> 0.05)**: Indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis.

`In the context of machine learning, a low p-value for a predictor suggests that the predictor is statistically significant and likely contributes meaningfully to the model. Conversely, a high p-value suggests that the predictor may not be significant and could be considered for removal from the model.`

In machine learning, the predictor with the highest p-value signifies that it is the least statistically significant variable in the model. A high p-value indicates that there is a high probability that the observed effect could have occurred by chance, suggesting that the variable may not be a meaningful predictor of the outcome.

### Filter Variables

- We can't use every variable in our model. somethings are just not that important
- Garbage in Garbage out
- Understand every variables is hard

### Fitting a Model

Fitting a model in machine learning is like teaching a robot to recognize patterns. Imagine you have a bunch of pictures of cats and dogs. You want the robot to learn how to tell the difference between them.

1. **Collect Data**: First, you show the robot many pictures of cats and dogs.
2. **Teach the Robot**: The robot looks at these pictures and tries to find patterns, like "cats usually have pointy ears" or "dogs often have floppy ears."
3. **Practice**: The robot keeps practicing with these pictures until it gets really good at telling cats from dogs.

When the robot has learned well, we say the model is "fitted" to the data. Now, when you show the robot a new picture, it can use what it learned to guess if it's a cat or a dog.

### Methods for Building Models(Filtering Variables)

> All in

- Include everything, You have to, all determine Equally,preparing for backward elimination. . .

> Backward Elimination
> `step-1` - select significance model (SL = 0.05)
> `step-2` - fit the full model with all possible predictors
> `step-3` - remove the predictor with the highest p-value
> `step-4` - fit the model without removed variable

> Forward Selection
> `step-1` - select significance model (SL = 0.05)
> `step-2` - fit every single variable with a simple regression model
> `step-3` - select one with the lowest p-value to be your model
> `step-4` - add all the remaining and create all possible 2-variable linear regression Models
> `step-5` - select one model with lowest p-value of all possible 2-variable linear regression Models

- and so on . . . . . until we see fit
  `step-6` - ones the lowest p-value becomes less than SL we stop this process

> Bidirection Elimination
> `step-1` - select significance model (SLENTER = 0.05, and SLSTAY = 0.05)
> `step-2` - perform forward elimination with SLENTER
> `step-3` - perform backward elimination with SLSTAY
> `step-4` - stop when no new variables can (enter and leave)

> All Possible Models
> `step-1` - select a criterion of goodness of fit (eg Akaike criteron)
> `step-2` - construct all possible Regression models 2\*\*N - 1 total combinations
> `step-3` - select one with the best criterion

The **All Possible Models** approach is a comprehensive method for selecting the best regression model by evaluating every possible combination of predictors. Here's a detailed explanation of each step:

#### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Select a Criterion of Goodness of Fit**:

   - Before constructing any models, you need to decide on a criterion to evaluate how well each model fits the data. Common criteria include:
     - **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**: Balances model fit and complexity, penalizing models with more predictors.
     - **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**: Similar to AIC but with a stronger penalty for models with more predictors.
     - **Adjusted R-squared**: Adjusts the R-squared value based on the number of predictors, preventing overfitting.

2. **Construct All Possible Regression Models**:

   - For [`N`] predictors, there are `2^N - 1` possible combinations of these predictors (excluding the model with no predictors).
   - For example, if you have 3 predictors (A, B, and C), the possible models are:
     - Model 1: A
     - Model 2: B
     - Model 3: C
     - Model 4: A + B
     - Model 5: A + C
     - Model 6: B + C
     - Model 7: A + B + C
   - This step involves fitting a regression model for each of these combinations.

3. **Select the Best Model Based on the Criterion**:
   - After fitting all possible models, you evaluate each one using the chosen criterion of goodness of fit.
   - The model that has the best (e.g., lowest AIC or BIC) criterion value is selected as the final model.
   - This ensures that the selected model provides the best balance between fit and complexity according to the chosen criterion.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages**:

  - Comprehensive: Evaluates all possible models, ensuring the best model is selected.
  - Objective: Uses a clear criterion for model selection.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Computationally Intensive: For a large number of predictors, the number of possible models grows exponentially, making this method computationally expensive.
  - Overfitting Risk: Without proper criteria, there's a risk of selecting overly complex models.

This method is best suited for situations where the number of predictors is relatively small, allowing for a thorough evaluation of all possible models.

## Computer Vision

- Template Matching: looking for an exact copy of an image in another image 


> Converting images to grayscale before detecting edges is a common preprocessing step in computer vision for several reasons:

1. **Simplification**: Grayscale images have only one channel (intensity) compared to three channels (red, green, blue) in color images. This simplification reduces the computational complexity and memory usage, making edge detection algorithms faster and more efficient.

2. **Noise Reduction**: Color images can introduce noise due to variations in color channels. Converting to grayscale helps in reducing this noise, leading to more accurate edge detection.

3. **Algorithm Requirements**: Many edge detection algorithms, such as the Canny edge detector or the Sobel operator, are designed to work on single-channel images. These algorithms compute gradients or intensity changes, which are more straightforward to calculate on grayscale images.

4. **Focus on Intensity Changes**: Edges in images are characterized by significant changes in intensity. Grayscale images represent intensity variations directly, making it easier for edge detection algorithms to identify these changes.


Contour detection in computer vision is a technique used to identify and extract the boundaries or outlines of objects within an image. Contours are curves that join all the continuous points along a boundary that have the same color or intensity. This technique is widely used in image analysis and computer vision tasks such as object detection, shape analysis, and image segmentation.

### Contour Detection

1. **Binary Image**: Contour detection typically requires a binary image, where the objects of interest are represented by white pixels (value 255) and the background is represented by black pixels (value 0). This binary image is often obtained through thresholding or edge detection techniques.

2. **Hierarchy**: Contours can be nested within each other, forming a hierarchy. For example, a contour of a hole inside an object is a child of the contour of the object.

3. **Contour Approximation**: Contours can be approximated to reduce the number of points in the contour representation. This is useful for simplifying the contour and reducing computational complexity.

### Steps for Contour Detection

1. **Convert to Grayscale**: If the input image is in color, it is first converted to a grayscale image.
2. **Apply Thresholding or Edge Detection**: Convert the grayscale image to a binary image using thresholding or edge detection (e.g., Canny edge detector).
3. **Find Contours**: Use a contour detection algorithm to find the contours in the binary image.

dododoyo: @workspace how to remove current virtual environment in python ?

Workspace: To remove the current virtual environment in Python, you can simply delete the directory where the virtual environment is stored. For example, if your virtual environment is named 

.venv

, you can delete it using the following command in the terminal:

```sh
rm -rf .venv
```

Make sure you are in the root directory of your project when you run this command. This will remove the 

.venv

 directory and all its contents.

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you might also want to update your workspace settings to remove any references to the deleted virtual environment. You can do this by editing the 

settings.json

 file and removing or updating the `python.pythonPath` setting.

dododoyo: @workspace why do we have to convert the images to grayscale to detect edges 

Workspace: Converting images to grayscale before detecting edges is a common preprocessing step in computer vision for several reasons:

1. **Simplification**: Grayscale images have only one channel (intensity) compared to three channels (red, green, blue) in color images. This simplification reduces the computational complexity and memory usage, making edge detection algorithms faster and more efficient.

2. **Noise Reduction**: Color images can introduce noise due to variations in color channels. Converting to grayscale helps in reducing this noise, leading to more accurate edge detection.

3. **Algorithm Requirements**: Many edge detection algorithms, such as the Canny edge detector or the Sobel operator, are designed to work on single-channel images. These algorithms compute gradients or intensity changes, which are more straightforward to calculate on grayscale images.

4. **Focus on Intensity Changes**: Edges in images are characterized by significant changes in intensity. Grayscale images represent intensity variations directly, making it easier for edge detection algorithms to identify these changes.

Here is an example of converting an image to grayscale using OpenCV before applying edge detection:

```python
import cv2 as cv
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read the image
image = cv.imread('../data/Files/DATA/sammy.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray_image = cv.cvtColor(image, cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply edge detection (e.g., Canny edge detector)
edges = cv.Canny(gray_image, 100, 200)

# Display the edges
plt.imshow(edges, cmap='gray')
plt.show()
```

In this example, the image is first read in color and then converted to grayscale using the [`cv.cvtColor`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdododoyo%2FDocuments%2FML%2F03-computer-vision%2FTemplateMatching.ipynb%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A70%2C%22character%22%3A18%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdododoyo%2FDocuments%2FML%2F03-computer-vision%2FTemplateMatching.ipynb%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A224%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%5D%2C%2292729147-882e-48a5-af45-00b597b01163%22%5D "Go to definition") function. The grayscale image is then passed to the [`cv.Canny`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22vscode-notebook-cell%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdododoyo%2FDocuments%2FML%2F03-computer-vision%2FCornerDetection.ipynb%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22X20sZmlsZQ%3D%3D%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%2C%2292729147-882e-48a5-af45-00b597b01163%22%5D "Go to definition") function to detect edges, and the result is displayed using Matplotlib.

dododoyo: @workspace What is contour detection in computer vision ?

Workspace: Contour detection in computer vision is a technique used to identify and extract the boundaries or outlines of objects within an image. Contours are curves that join all the continuous points along a boundary that have the same color or intensity. This technique is widely used in image analysis and computer vision tasks such as object detection, shape analysis, and image segmentation.

### Key Concepts of Contour Detection

1. **Binary Image**: Contour detection typically requires a binary image, where the objects of interest are represented by white pixels (value 255) and the background is represented by black pixels (value 0). This binary image is often obtained through thresholding or edge detection techniques.

2. **Hierarchy**: Contours can be nested within each other, forming a hierarchy. For example, a contour of a hole inside an object is a child of the contour of the object.

3. **Contour Approximation**: Contours can be approximated to reduce the number of points in the contour representation. This is useful for simplifying the contour and reducing computational complexity.

#### Steps for Contour Detection

1. **Convert to Grayscale**: If the input image is in color, it is first converted to a grayscale image.
2. **Apply Thresholding or Edge Detection**: Convert the grayscale image to a binary image using thresholding or edge detection (e.g., Canny edge detector).
3. **Find Contours**: Use a contour detection algorithm to find the contours in the binary image.


### Template Matching

Template matching involves searching for a smaller image (template) within a larger image by sliding the template over the larger image and comparing the template to the sub-regions of the larger image. The comparison is typically done using correlation or similarity measures.

#### Advantages of Template Matching:
1. **Simplicity**: Template matching is straightforward to implement and understand.
2. **Exact Matches**: It works well when the template is an exact cut-out of the object in the larger image.

#### Disadvantages of Template Matching:
1. **Scale and Rotation Sensitivity**: Template matching is sensitive to changes in scale and rotation. If the object in the larger image is scaled or rotated relative to the template, the matching may fail.
2. **Lighting and Occlusion Sensitivity**: Variations in lighting and partial occlusions can significantly affect the accuracy of template matching.
3. **Computationally Intensive**: Sliding the template over the entire image and computing similarity measures for each position can be computationally expensive, especially for large images.

### Feature Matching

Feature matching involves detecting key points and descriptors in both the template and the larger image and then matching these features to find correspondences. Common algorithms for feature detection and description include SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features), and ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF).

#### Advantages of Feature Matching:
1. **Scale and Rotation Invariance**: Feature matching algorithms are designed to be invariant to changes in scale and rotation, making them more robust to variations in object size and orientation.
2. **Robustness to Lighting and Occlusion**: Feature matching can handle variations in lighting and partial occlusions better than template matching, as it relies on distinctive key points rather than pixel-by-pixel comparison.
3. **Efficiency**: Once features are detected and described, matching them is generally more efficient than sliding a template over the entire image.

#### Disadvantages of Feature Matching:
1. **Complexity**: Feature matching algorithms are more complex to implement and understand compared to template matching.
2. **Parameter Tuning**: Feature detection and description algorithms often require careful tuning of parameters to achieve optimal performance.
